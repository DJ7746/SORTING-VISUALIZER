A web application showcasing the inner workings of sorting algorithms.

Implemented algorithms:

1.Bubble sort

2.Selection sort

3.Insertion sort

4.Merge sort

5.Quick sort

6.Heap sort


Features:

1.Colored representation of step being executed:-

a) Blue: default

b) Yellow: Being compared

c) Red: Identified as in incorrect position and to be moved

d) Green: In correct position



2. Three controls for visualizations:-
   
a) Speed of visualization (5 speed levels)

b) Data size ()

c) Generation of new data (Randomly generate new data).




3.Time and Space complexity of algorithm being visualized.
